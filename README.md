# flask_6_api_management



## 1. Flask-based RESTful API:
Utilize Flask to develop an endpoint that can handle a simple GET request.
The response should be in JSON format. 

As shown in the class example the format is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1

As the screenshot shows, and endpoint was developed and a GET request was implemented as shown in the screenshot.
