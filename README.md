# flask_6_api_management



## 1. Flask-based RESTful API:
Utilize Flask to develop an endpoint that can handle a simple GET request.
The response should be in JSON format. 

As shown in the class example the format is https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1

As the screenshot shows, and endpoint was developed and a GET request was implemented as shown in the screenshot.

I also did the same thing with the phrase "Hello from MALIHAS Flask API Endpoint Server" as shown below.

This is the url when you change authuser to hello
https://5000-cs-741144739238-default.cs-us-east1-rtep.cloudshell.dev/hello

This is the url and it shows the name " Hello Rameama " 
In order to do this at the end of the URL after hello, i put ?name=rameama
https://5000-cs-741144739238-default.cs-us-east1-rtep.cloudshell.dev/hello?name=rameama

## 2. Azure API deployment:
I deployed this through GCP because I do not have anymore Azure credits. In order to do this I followed the instructions that were present in the assignment.
